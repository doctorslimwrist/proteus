Your brain is constantly taking in sensory information. The conscious part of your brain needs to filter these, deciding which ones to pay attention to.
## Putting nets over things
If you try to grab onto a fish that is flopping around, you won't be very successful unless you try to get a net over it. Because we have limited sensory ability to process the wild world as it flails around us, we have no choice but to create abstractions over the top of reality. These provide a useful framework to simplify processing -- if this, then that. And it's all automatic. 

The nature of cutting corners is that it can result in undesirable outcomes. In a physical system, for a given failure you'd take a look at the decision points along the road that led to the failure. 

For cognitive shortcuts, though, the sequence of choices is often subconscious --a "black box" handling what inputs should result in what outputs-- making it harder to understand the problem.

If you have a sense for what shortcuts your brain habitually takes, you can begin to pick apart why you feel a certain way.
