I meditate a lot. Like a lot. For me, the value of sitting in your own mind, getting comfortable observing the thoughts flying around, is one of the most valuable things a person can do to identify their [[fundamental assumptions about the world]] and the way it works.
# Putting nets over things
When you try to grab onto a fish that is flopping around, you won't be very successful unless you try to get a net over it. Because we have limited sensory ability, we have no choice but to create abstractions over the top of reality to try and make sense of it. These provide a useful framework to simplify processing -- if this, then that. And it's all automatic. 

But the nature of cutting corners is that it can result in undesirable outcomes. In a physical system, for a given failure you'd take a look at the decision points along the road that led to the failure. 

For cognitive shortcuts, though, the sequence of choices is often subconscious --a "black box" handling what inputs should result in what outputs-- making it harder to understand the problem.
