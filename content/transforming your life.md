I meditate a lot. Like a lot. For me, the value of sitting in your own mind, getting comfortable observing the thoughts flying around, is one of the most valuable things a person can do to identify their [[fundamental assumptions about the world]] and the way it works.

It was through meditating on these things that I came to understand that the world has a strong insistence on imposing a ruleset over the top of reality. When you try to grab onto a fish that is flopping around, you won't be very successful unless you try to get a net over it. Humans have a tendency to apply these cognitive "nets" over reality to provide a useful framework to simplify processing. One of these nets involves gender.
