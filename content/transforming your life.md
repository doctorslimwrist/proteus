Transition is hard. I began medical transition 14 months ago, and each day brings new challenges. Very often, a problem that arises ends up being the hardest thing I've ever had to navigate up until that point. This feels more and more true as my transition progresses.

When you're changing yourself from the inside out, you have to develop a way of coping with the shock of having to relearn everything in your life. 

I'm cultivating this digital garden so that I can continually revisit my strategies for coping with the demands of transition.

## [[Finding Community]]
This was the single most important factor in the improvement of my mental health. As I began transition, I found that difficult paths are best walked together.

## [[Courage]] in the Face of Difficulty
You don't need to look far to find examples of the difficulty of living while trans. It's important to have a strong foundation to retreat to when they arise.

## [[Meditation]] to Reflect on Progress
I meditate a lot. Like a lot. For me, the value of sitting in your own mind, getting comfortable [[observing the thoughts]] flying around, is one of the most valuable things a person can do to identify their [[fundamental assumptions about the world]] and the way it works.

## [[Maintaining Consistency]] in Transition
The estrogen doesn't work unless you take it. You also need to make sure your body's needs are met!
