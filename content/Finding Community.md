I found my first trans friends through Lex, an app known more for inane discourse about AFAB-only housing than for helping people in early transition find community.

I saw a post about a movie marathon, responded to it, and showed up at someone's apartment for the first time as myself. It was terrifying. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

The group was watching anime or possibly the Matrix -- my memory is hazy. What I remember is that the TV speakers were deafening and I had never felt more out of place, but that I felt like I had stumbled onto something that could save me.

With this group, I went to movie nights and bar crawls, and eventually I met a trans woman with a Discord server mostly filled with local trans people. From there, I began to meet new trans women at a dizzying rate, launching me into a period of personal development like I had never experienced. 

As I began to get my bearings in this entirely new social scene, I realized that in order to have community, you have to [[make community]].
