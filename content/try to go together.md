> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

It is important to walk together with others in the process of [[transforming your life]] from the inside out. I will never forget how alone I felt during those early years. It didn’t start to get better until I stumbled across the first glimpse of a shared world. It wasn't until then that I learned a better world is possible. [[Finding Community]] is an important early step in anyone's gender transition.

The path running from my earliest realizations of transness to finding community was a long one.

My gender journey began with the article [That’s gender dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) — a collaborative piece about what exactly gender dysphoria is, and what it means.

I spent a very long time wrestling with this realization. It had serious and deep implications. If I wanted to transition, it would require giving up nearly everything I had worked for. [[Courage]] didn't even seem to begin to cover it. My mind wanted to probe every aspect of what undertaking such a transformation would require, because the fear was all-consuming.

I had actually begun to transition before I found community. I know now that this period of questioning, denial, and bargaining would have been much shorter if I had had someone I could talk to.

When I met other people like me, it opened a door into a world I never knew was possible.
