Transition is incredibly difficult.

I will never forget how alone I felt during those early years. It didn’t start to get better until I stumbled across the first glimpse of a shared world.

For me, it began with the article [That’s gender dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) — a community-written piece about what exactly gender dysphoria is, and what it means.

I spent a very long time wrestling with this realization. It had serious and deep implications. If I wanted to transition, it would require giving up nearly everything I had worked for. My mind wanted to probe every aspect of what undertaking such a transformation would require, and I spent a really long time in this phase.

I had actually begun to transition before I found community. I know now that this period of questioning, denial, and bargaining would have been much shorter if I had had someone I could talk to.
