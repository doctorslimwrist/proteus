There will be several chapters in this series, each about a different aspect of the experience of [[transforming your being]], one of the most difficult and rewarding things you can ever do.

My primary motivation in writing this is to keep track of my own thoughts on the process.

For me, the beginning of a series of transformative realizations began with the excellent [That's gender dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) community-written article about what exactly gender dysphoria is, and what it means.

I spent a very long time wrestling with this realization. It had serious and deep implications. If I wanted to transition, it would require giving up nearly everything I had worked for. My mind wanted to probe every aspect of what undertaking such a transformation would require, and I spent a really long time in this [[deconstruction phase]].
