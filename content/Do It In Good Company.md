There will be several chapters in this series, each about a different aspect of the experience of [[transforming your life]], one of the most difficult and rewarding things you can ever do.

My primary motivation in writing this is to keep track of my own thoughts on the process.

I will never forget how alone I felt during those early years. It didn't start to get better until I stumbled across the first glimpse of a shared world.

For me, it began with the article [That's gender dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) -- a community-written piece about what exactly gender dysphoria is, and what it means.

I spent a very long time wrestling with this realization. It had serious and deep implications. If I wanted to transition, it would require giving up nearly everything I had worked for. My mind wanted to probe every aspect of what undertaking such a transformation would require, and I spent a really long time in this [[deconstruction phase]].
