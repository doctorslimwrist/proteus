By this I mean: what shortcuts are you taking when you are presented new information?

Think about your brain for a minute. There is a part of it currently occupied with regulating your heartbeat; another area manages your balance. There are areas of your brain responsible for managing the processing that occurs just underneath your conscious attention, as well as the parts dedicated to conscious attention itself. 

The part of your brain dedicated to conscious attention can only process the world in lines, the way you'd move the beam of a flashlight around. Reality, on the other hand, comes at us in an impossibly dense and never-ending wave of inputs. If the brain were required to process every single bit of data coming in through the senses, it would be incredibly overwhelming. So the brain takes shortcuts to separate the meaningful inputs from the whirling chaos outside.
